## NOTE: below steps to run the program do not currently work as the database for the course has ended as of May 2022, thus logging in doesn't work
However, html files can still be opened and viewed


## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Getting Started:
1. after git cloning this repo, run "npm install" in your terminal
2. then run the program with "node index.js"
3. open up a browser tab with the url "localhost:8757"
4. you will be prompted to login - possible logins are below:

acc_login: "user"
acc_password: "pass"

other logins that also work:
acc_login: "admin"
acc_password: "admin

Files to focus on are the index.js and /client folder.
Index.js stores all server-side code while all client-side web pages are stored as html pages in the /client folder.
